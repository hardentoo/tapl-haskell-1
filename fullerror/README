Haskell port of the fullerror OCaml implementation of TAPL, which is described in Chapter 13.

SAMPLE USAGE:

> make test

> make
> ./f test.f

See the Makefile for all targets.

NOTE:

test.f is copied from the OCaml implementation, but lines involving Top were removed, since they have not yet been covered, as of Chapter 14.
