Haskell port of the bot OCaml implementation of TAPL, which is referred to at the end of Chapter 16.

SAMPLE USAGE:

> make test

> make
> ./f test.f

See the Makefile for all targets.

NOTES:

Formatting changes have been made to test.out, which was originally constructed as the output of calling the OCaml implementation on test.f.
