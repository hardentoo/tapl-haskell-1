This project Haskell ports of the OCaml implementations of "Types and Programming Languages" (TAPL), by Benjamin C. Pierce.

Other than the "common" subdirectory, each subdirectory maps the corresponding
one found at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/.  Each one has a Makefile,
which documents the available targets.

To test the entire project, enter the "common" subdirectory and execute "make all-test"

To run interactively, you will need to augment the include path.  For example,
from within the "arith" subdirectory, invoke ghci using:

  ghci -i../common

It depends on the Parsec and HUnit libraries.
  
These implementations have only been tested using GHC on Ubuntu, with the above libraries installed.

TODO:
* My make-fu is horrible.  In particular, "common" does make it's own libraries.  And I'm sure there are other ways this part of the project can be improved/fixed.
