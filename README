This project Haskell ports of the OCaml implementations of "Types and Programming Languages" (TAPL), by Benjamin C. Pierce.

Other than the "common" subdirectory, each subdirectory maps the corresponding
one found at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/.  Each one has a Makefile,
which documents the available targets.

To test the entire project, enter the "common" subdirectory and execute "make all-test"

To run interactively, you will need to augment the include path.  For example,
from within the "arith" subdirectory, invoke ghci using:

  ghci -i../common -i../common/HUnit-1.0

These implementations have only been tested using ghc-6.8.1 on Ubuntu 7.10.

TODO:
* My make-fu is horrible.  In particular, "common" does make it's own libraries.  And I'm sure there are other ways this part of the project can be improved/fixd.

* A version of HUnit is included, which make the project self-contained, but is the wrong long-term solution.
