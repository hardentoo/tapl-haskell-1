Haskell port of the fullref OCaml implementation of TAPL, which is described in Chapter 12

SAMPLE USAGE:

> make test

> make
> ./f test.f

See the Makefile for all targets.

NOTES:

test.f and test.out come from the fullsimple implementation, not the OCaml fullref implementation, because that test.f seem to be intended for Chapter 15.  Test cases for the new functionality are in Tests.hs.
