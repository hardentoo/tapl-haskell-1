Haskell port of the fullsub OCaml implementation of TAPL, which is described in Chapter 15.  It adds subtyping to fullsimple

SAMPLE USAGE:

> make test

> make
> ./f test.f

See the Makefile for all targets.

ORGANIZATION:

All functionality except for typing comes from the "nontyping" subdirectory of the fullsimple implementation.  In this directory, we only add a new Typing.hs module, for subtyping (and a Makefile and a test suite, which itself inherits many tests from fullsimple).

NOTES:

Formatting changes have been made to test.out, which was originally constructed as the output of calling the OCaml implementation on test.f.
