Haskell port of the fullsimple OCaml implementation of TAPL, which is introduced in Chapter 9, and fully described in Chapter 11.

It makes use of code generation-- see ../generator/README.

SAMPLE USAGE:

> make test

> make
> ./f test.f

See the Makefile for all targets.

NOTES:

Formatting changes have been made to test.out, which was originally constructed as the output of calling the OCaml implementation on test.f.
